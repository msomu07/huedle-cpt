            <p> ✧ The objective of this game is for you to
                guess the RGB value of the randomly generated
                color/s. <br><br>
                ✧ In level 1, you will get six chances to guess
                one color <br><br>
                ✧ In level 2, you will get __ chances to guess 
                three colors <br><br>
                ✧ You will know how close your RGB values are to 
                the actual answer by the coloring of the input 
                values after they are entered - blue means that
                the value is far off and red means that the value
                is very close, kind of like in a hot-cold game 
                <br><br>
                ✧ When an RGB input that you guessed is within 
                5 of the actual value, that square will turn green 
                <br><br>
                ✧ If you guess the exact color value, the square will
                turn yellow <br><br>
                ✧ When all the input squares are green, you've won
                the game! <br><br>
                ✧ If all three squares are yellow, you are a MEGA
                WINNER!!!
