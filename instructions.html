            <p> ✧ The objective of this game is for you to
                guess the RGB value of the randomly generated
                color(s). <br><br>
                ✧ In level 1, you will get six chances to guess
                one color <br><br>
                ✧ In level 2, you will get ten chances to guess 
                three colors simultaneously <br><br>
                ✧ You will know how close your RGB values are to 
                the actual answer by the coloring of the input 
                values after they are entered. This diagram allows you
                to determine how far your guess is from the actual answer.
                You can always refer to it on the game page by clicking 
                the "instructions" button at the top.
                <br><br>
                ✧ When an RGB input that you guessed is within 
                5 of the actual value, that square will turn green 
                <br><br>
                ✧ When all the input squares are green, you've won
                the game!
